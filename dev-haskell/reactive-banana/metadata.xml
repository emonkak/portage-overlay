		A small but solid library for functional reactive programming (FRP).

		The current focus of this library is to implement
		a subset of the semantic model for functional reactive programming
		pioneered by Conal Elliott.

		Moreover, this library can hooked into /any/
		existing event-based framework.
		It is especially useful in conjunction with existing
		GUI frameworks like @wxHaskell@ or @gtk2hs@.

		This also means that your code can be a mix of FRP and imperative parts.
		Bored of programming imperative GUIs? Write some parts with FRP!
		Don&#39;t know how to express something with FRP?
		Switch back to imperative style!

		In the spectrum of possible FRP implementations,
		this one features simple semantics but modest expressivity.
		Predicting space &amp; time usage should be easy.

		Stability forecast:
		Known inefficiencies that will be addressed.
		No semantic bugs expected.
		Significant API changes are likely in future versions.
